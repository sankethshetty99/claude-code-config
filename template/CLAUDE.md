# Project: [Project Name]

## Tech Stack
<!-- Update this section when you start working on a project -->
- **Frontend:**
- **Backend:**
- **Database:**
- **Deployment:**

## Engineering Preferences
- **DRY is important** — flag repetition aggressively
- **Well-tested code is non-negotiable** — too many tests > too few
- **"Engineered enough"** — not under-engineered (fragile, hacky) and not over-engineered (premature abstraction, unnecessary complexity)
- **Handle more edge cases, not fewer** — err on the side of coverage
- **Explicit over clever** — thoughtfulness > speed

## Code Review & Change Workflow
When reviewing code or proposing changes:
- For every issue: describe concretely with file and line references, present 2–3 options (including "do nothing" where reasonable), recommend one with rationale, and ask before proceeding
- **Large changes:** Work interactively one section at a time (Architecture → Code Quality → Tests → Performance), at most 4 top issues per section, pause after each section for feedback
- **Small changes:** One question per review section
- Number issues and letter options (e.g., "Issue 1, Option A") so choices are unambiguous
- Do not assume priorities on timeline or scale

## Project Context
<!-- This section will grow as you work on the project. Add key architectural decisions, domain knowledge, and important context here. -->
